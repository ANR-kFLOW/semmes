# Workshop description 

An important part of human history and knowledge is made of events, which can be aggregated and connected to create stories, be they real or fictional. These events as well as the stories created from them can typically be inherently complex, reflect societal or political stances and be perceived differently across the world population. The Semantic Web offers technologies and methods to represent these events and stories, as well as to interpret the knowledge encoded into graphs and use it for different applications, spanning from narrative understanding and generation to fact-checking. 

The aim of SEMMES is to offer an opportunity to discuss the challenges related to dealing with events and stories, and how we can use semantic methods to tackle them. We welcome approaches which combine data, methods and technologies coming from the Semantic Web with methods from other fields, including machine learning, narratology or information extraction. This workshop wants to bring together researchers working on complementary topics, in order to foster collaboration and sharing of expertise in the context of events and stories.
